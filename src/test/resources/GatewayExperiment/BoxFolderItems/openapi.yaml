  description: >-
    [Box Platform](https://box.dev) provides functionality to provide access to
    content stored within [Box](https://box.com). It provides endpoints for
    basic manipulation of files and folders, management of users within an
    enterprise, as well as more complex topics such as legal holds and retention
    policies.

        Retrieves a page of items in a folder. These items can be files,
        folders, and web links.

        To request more information about the folder itself, like its size,
        please use the [Get a folder](#get-folders-id) endpoint instead.
      parameters:
        - name: folder_id
          description: |-
            The unique identifier that represent a folder.

            The ID for any folder can be determined
            by visiting this folder in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
            for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
            the `folder_id` is `123`.

            The root folder of a Box account is
            always represented by the ID `0`.
          example: '12345'
          in: path

        - name: fields
          description: |-
            A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
            response. This can be used to request fields that are
            not normally returned in a standard response.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
            effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.

            Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
            applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
            as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
            `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.
          in: query
          example:
            - id

          description: |-
            Specifies whether to use marker-based pagination instead of
            offset-based pagination. Only one pagination method can
            be used at a time.

            By setting this value to true, the API will return a `marker` field
            that can be passed as a parameter to this endpoint to get the next
            page of the response.
          in: query
          required: false
          example: true

            Defines the position marker at which to begin returning results.
            This is

            used when paginating using marker-based pagination.


            This requires `usemarker` to be set to `true`.
          in: query

        - name: offset
          description: |-
            The offset of the item at which to begin the response.

            Queries with offset parameter value
            exceeding 10000 will be rejected
            with a 400 response.

            This header can be used to access items that have not been

            explicitly shared with a user.


            Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required
            then

            use `shared_link=[link]&shared_link_password=[password]`.


            This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on
            any files

            or folders nested within the item.

            Defines the **second** attribute by which items
            are sorted.

            Items are always sorted by their `type` first, with
            folders listed before files, and files listed
            before web links.

            This parameter is not supported for marker-based pagination
            on the root folder (the folder with an ID of `0`).

            list of

            This attribute takes a list of item fields, metadata template
            identifiers,

            or metadata template field identifiers.


            For example:


            * `created_by` will add the details of the user who created the item
            to

            the response.

            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>` will return the
            mini-representation

            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and
            `templateKey`.

            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>.<field>` will return all the
            mini-representation

            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and `templateKey`
            plus

            the field specified by the `field` name. Multiple fields for the

                    and `templateKey`.


                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the

                    metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates
                    available to your

                    enterprise.


                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`

                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get

                    the metadata by ID.


                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and
                    `templateKey`

                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:

                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`


                    For example,
                    `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.

                    and `templateKey`.


                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the

                    metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates
                    available to your

                    enterprise.


                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`

                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get

                    the metadata by ID.


                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and
                    `templateKey`

                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:

                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`


                    For example,
                    `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.

        Web links are objects that point to URLs. These objects

        Web link objects are treated similarly to file objects,
        they will also support most actions that apply to regular files.

                    An example would be where a Box Drive-like application

                    would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming

                    user events for changes to the item. The application would

                    ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event

                    is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the
